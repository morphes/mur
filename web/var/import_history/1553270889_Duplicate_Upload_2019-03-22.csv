These compact modules measure 2.3"" X 2.4"" X 0.5"" (58 X 61 X 12.7mm) and offer the industry-standard Half Brick footprint. The PAH Series is ideal for power amplifier applications, wireless networks, and telecom applications. The baseplate provides a means for conduction cooling in demanding thermal environment conditions. The module provides a 28Vdc output at 12.5 Amps and accepts a wide input voltage range of 18-36Vdc. The PAH topology offers high effi ciency (up to 92.5%), tight line and load regulation, low ripple/noise, and a fast dynamic load response. A single-board, highly optimized thermal design contributes to the superior thermal performance. These half-bricks provide output trim, sense pins, and primary side on/off control. Standard features also include input under-voltage shutdown, output over-voltage protection, output short-circuit/ current limiting protection, and thermal shutdown.","Isolated, 350 Watt, Half-Brick DC-DC Converter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,28,,,,,,24,,,,999,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,10000,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0

Both gain (span) and offset (zero) adjustments are performed with on-board, precision, 20-turn potentiometers. All decimal-point and range-change selections are made on a six-position DIP switch featuring vibration-resistant, gold-plated contacts. Unlike competitive meters, there are no jumpers or solder gaps to open or close. Connections to the current loop are made via a reliable, two-position, screw-type terminal block.
The DMR20-4/20’s DIP-switch and potentiometers accommodate hundreds of different input-current/output-reading combinations. This versatility eliminates the need to order more costly, long-lead-time customs meters in applications in which several different-range meters are required.
