<b>NEW Interactive PC Based Short Range Radio RF Circuit Design Assistant Tool software Released!

</b><p>

<font face="arial" size="2" color="000000">

Tired of reading datasheets, application notes or other long documents to help you design-in an RF Transceiver, Receiver, Transmitter or Module into your application? 
Look no further…<p>

Check out RF Monolithics’ (RFM) new and improved, easy to use, illustrative and time effective Short Range Radio RF Circuit Design Assistant Tool software – the "ASH Design Assistant Version 2". Version 2 comes as a follow-on to its predecessor "ASH Design Assistant" software that was very well received by the engineering community which uses RFM’s Virtual Wire® (VWO) products. 
<p>

The Design Assistant software tool was developed by Dan Nelson, RFM’s European Field Applications Engineer, who has extensive knowledge of RFM’s products and has helped various customers with their design applications.
The Design Assistant software is FREE of charge from RFM <a href="ASHV2_5_4.zip"></font><font face="arial" size="2" color="ff0000"><b>Click Here to download Software.</b></font></a><font face="arial" size="2" color="000000"> <b>(see installation instructions below).</b>
The new software is very easy to install on standard PC platforms and is a 'must have' for RF and digital development engineers implementing RFM's VWO components.  
<p>

Version 2 is a revisit of the "ASH Transceiver Designer's Guide" (the ASH hardware designer's technical document) and it translates design formulae, practices, and procedures of the ASH VWO circuits into an easy to use, interactive design/development tool that will save hours of engineering R & D time.

<b>Features of the New Design Assistant Tool include:</b>
<p>
<ul><li>	Frequency Selection Guide and configuration summaries for all RFM Transceivers, Transmitters, Receivers and 
Modules
<li>	User device selection of VWO components for design or DR Modules for quick prototyping
<li>	Circuit diagram of user’s design
<li>	Calculated parts count and component values for user design
<li>	A 'Radio Range Estimation Calculator' with calculation software for estimating radio range associated with user’s 
design data
<li>	Selectable ancillary interface circuit options
<li>	User design settings including modulation selection, air data rate selection, signal encoding method, data slicer set 
up, AGC selection, Pulse Width-Rate set up, transmit power selection notes, RSSI circuit notes and Receiver data interface information
<li>	A "DR Module Explorer" section which identifies RFM's RF transceiver radio module options, its anatomy, and tips on  'how to modify' to meet specific customization needs
<li>	An assortment of common SRD antenna types and criteria that can be 'virtually' tried  and tested by the user for range calculations
<li>	Quick and easy  HELP button selection  for direct topic help as well as informative hints and explanations 
</ul>
<p>
The “ASH Design Assistant Version 2" software is a testament to the fact that RFM not only offers excellent, high quality products such as the VWO components and modules with lowest power consumption in the industry, excellent range and optimal receiver sensitivity, ideal for designing robust short-range wireless applications, but also provides excellent technical support to our customers who want to design in these products with effective, easy to use and time saving tools!
