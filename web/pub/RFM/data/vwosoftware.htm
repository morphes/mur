<font face="arial" size="2"><br><b>Attention 2nd Generation<br>Virtual Wire® Development Kit Owners!</b>

<p>Click here to download <a href="../../vwo/newdocs2.zip">newdocs2.zip</a>, which includes updated manuals, improved PC terminal programs for Windows and DOS, installation docs, an application programming guide, plus ASH radio data sheets and designer's guides, etc. This update is for the following kits:






       <p>DR1200-DK       916.50 MHz Development Kit
   <br>DR1201-DK       868.35 MHz Development Kit

<td><ul><font face="arial" size="2">The <a href="../../vwo/newdocs2.zip">newdocs2.zip</a> update includes the v000t46g and v000t46h 
enhanced terminal programs, which replace and expand on the v000t46a terminal program offered here 
previously. These enhanced terminal programs gather link statistics and display summary data in pie 
chart format. These terminal programs also allow you to send and save ASCII text files. The "g" 
version is intended for slower host computers and the "h" version will give higher throughput on 
faster computers.<p>

<font face="arial" size="2">No protocol software changes (microcontroller firmware) are required to take advantage of this update!
If your kit came with a paper manual and floppy disks, we suggest you discard the paper manual and 
floppy disks and use this "new and improved" material instead.</td></tr>

<font face="arial" size="2"><b>New "A" Series Kit Information</b>

<p>Click here to download <a href="../../vwo/a_kits.zip">a_kits.zip</a>, which includes all the files on the CD that comes 
with the new "A" series kits. The "A" series kits are tuned for long operating range 
and high noise immunity, which is achieved by lowering the air data rate and using noise 
tolerant<p>

<font face="arial" size="2">protocol methods, etc. The "A" series kits also incorporate the PCB layout methods 
recommended for EMC robust operation. The "A" series product line includes:


    <p>DR1200A-DK 916.50 MHz Development Kit
   <br>DR1201A-DK 868.35 MHz Development Kit
   <br>DR1300A-DK 433.92 MHz Development Kit

<p>
RFM is now accepting orders for the "A" series kits. The "A" series kits do not 
replace the standard kits, but provide an alternative hardware-software configuration 
that emphasizes long operating range.


<font face="arial" size="2">
<p><b>Optional Standard Kit Software (not for "A" series)</b>

<p>Note: the software options below require you to reprogram the microcontrollers on the protocol boards. If you want to go back to the original protocol that came with the kits, you will find the object code for the original protocol in the <a href="../../vwo/newdocs2.zip">newdocs2.zip</a> file discussed above. Be sure to use the terminal programs that match the protocol you have programmed into your microcontrollers!

<p>Click here to download <a href="../../vwo/option3.zip">option3.zip</a>, which includes an alternate link-layer protocol V820A along with matching terminal programs for Windows and DOS, installation docs and an application programming guide. This option applies to the following development kits:

<p>DR1200-DK 916.50 MHz Development Kit 
<br>DR1201-DK 868.35 MHz Development Kit 
<br>DR1300-DK 433.92 MHz Development Kit

<p>Key improvements include simplified applications programming, better DC-balanced encoding, improved noise tolerance, faster throughput, framing characters between packets sent to the host, and jumper-selectable "headerless" output for driving small printers, etc. where you cannot install custom software. To use this option, you need the capability to reprogram the microcontollers on the protocol boards.

<p>Click here to download <a href="../../vwo/option2.zip">option2.zip</a>, which includes an alternate link-layer protocol V520 (and V520A) along with terminal programs for Windows and DOS, installation docs and an application programming guide. This upgrade also applies to the following development kits (any suffix):

<p>DR1200-DK 916.50 MHz Development Kit
<br>DR1201-DK 868.35 MHz Development Kit
<br>DR1300-DK 433.92 MHz Development Kit

<p>Key improvements include simplified applications programming, improved noise tolerance, faster throughput, and jumper-selectable "headerless" output for driving small printers, etc. where you cannot install custom software. To use this option, you need the capability to reprogram the microcontoller on the protocol boards.

<p>Click here to download <a href="../../vwo/v520t01a.zip">v520t01a.zip</a>, which is another Visual Basic terminal program for option2.zip. This terminal program includes separate text windows for incoming and outgoing messages, and optional source address/ID displays for incoming messages. Source files included.
