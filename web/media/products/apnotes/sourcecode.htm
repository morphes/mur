<center><b>RF MONOLITHICS, INC. SOURCE CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT</b></center><br>
<br>
<b>THIS SOURCE CODE LICENSE AGREEMENT</b> (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of the Effective Date set
forth below between <b>RF MONOLITHICS, INC.</b> (“RFM”) and the Licensee identified below. RFM owns certain
proprietary software programs and is willing to make the human-readable source code for
such programs (together with any compiled versions of the source code delivered, the “Source Code”) available to
Licensee for use solely in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
fee as set forth in Exhibit A. This Agreement will become effective as of the Effective Date and will continue in
effect until and unless it is terminated in accordance with the terms of Section 8.<br>
<br>
<b>1. Grant of License.</b> Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, RFM grants to Licensee a
non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide internal
license, without license to distribute or sublicense, to
use, copy, modify, and create derivative works from the
Source Code, to compile the Source Code (in its
original form or as modified by Licensee) into
executable code, and to use such executable code solely
in conjunction with those RFM products.<br>
<br>
<b>2. Use of Software.</b> Licensee may modify the Source
Code only for the purpose of creating software
programs to be used in conjunction with RFM Products.
Licensee may use the software programs generated from
the Source Code and any modifications thereof only in
conjunction with RFM Products. Any other use of the
executable code generated from compiling this Source
Code, or any modifications to or use of the Source Code
is not permitted. Licensee may use independent
contractors to make modifications to the Source Code
provided that each such independent contractor signs a
confidentiality agreement with Licensee containing
terms no less restrictive than the terms of this
Agreement. Any updated versions of the Source Code
delivered to Licensee shall be subject to the same terms
and conditions as this Agreement.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Copying.</b> Licensee may make unlimited copies of
the Source Code provided that Licensee (i) reproduces
all RFM proprietary rights notices and legends on each
copy and (ii) uses the copies only as permitted by this
Agreement.<br>
<br>
<b>4. Ownership.</b> RFM retains ownership of all rights in
and title to the Source Code, including but not limited
to all copyrights, patent rights, and trade secrets in the
Source Code. Licensee grants RFM a perpetual, non-exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-free license to use all
modifications of the Source Code made by Licensee.
Licensee will promptly notify RFM of any software
programs generated from modifications Licensee makes
to the Source Code that Licensee uses in conjunction
with RFM Products, and Licensee will furnish a
complete description of the functionality of such
program.<br>
<br>
<b>5. Confidentiality.</b> Licensee
acknowledges that the Source Code is RFM’s valuable
and proprietary information and the unauthorized use or
disclosure of the Source Code would cause severe
damage to RFM. Accordingly, Licensee agrees to hold
the Source Code in strict confidence, protecting the
Source Code with measures at least as protective as
those used to protect its own most valuable trade secrets
(but in no event less than reasonable measures for
highly sensitive materials) and to inform RFM
immediately if Licensee becomes aware of any
unauthorized use or disclosure of the Source Code.
Licensee will limit access to the Source Code to those
of its employees and permitted contractors who need
access for purposes permitted by this Agreement, and
will inform such employees and contractors of the
restrictions on their use and disclosure of the Source
Code under this Agreement.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Warranty Disclaimers.</b> RFM does not warrant that
the Source Code or any software program generated
from the Source Code will meet Licensee’s specific
needs or that Licensee’s use of such programs will be
uninterrupted or error-free. LICENSE ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT THE SOURCE CODE IS SUPPLIED HEREUNDER ON
AN “AS IS” BASIS. RFM EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS AND IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT,
REGARDING LICENSEE’S USE OF THE
SOURCE CODE.<br>
<br>
<b>7. Limitation of Liability.</b> IN NO EVENT WILL RFM
BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES ARISING
FROM LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SOURCE CODE, EVEN
IF RFM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES. RFM’S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING
FROM LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SOURCE CODE WILL
BE LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES OF NO MORE THAN
THE LICENSE FEE PAID BY LICENSEE FOR SUCH
SOURCE CODE, IF ANY. Licensee acknowledges and
agrees that the foregoing amount is not an estimate of
damages and will not be admissible for any purpose in
any action against RFM unless RFM consents in
writing.<br>
<br>
<b>8. Termination.</b> Licensee may terminate this
Agreement at any time upon notice to RFM. RFM may
terminate this Agreement immediately upon written
notice to Licensee of Licensee’s breach of any term of
this Agreement. Upon any termination of this
Agreement, Licensee must promptly return to RFM all
copies of the Source Code (in its original form or as
modified by Licensee), and any notes, documentation,
and other items embodying the algorithms or techniques
contained in the Source Code. Sections 5, 6, 7 and 11
shall survive any termination of this Agreement.<br>
<br>
<b>9. Government Users.</b> This paragraph applies only to
Licensees that are branches or agencies of the U.S.
Government. The Source Code was developed entirely
at private expense and without the use of any U.S.
Government funds. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (JUNE
1995), all U.S. Government end users acquire the
Source Code with only those rights set forth in this
Agreement.<br>
<br>
<b>10. Notices.</b> All notices, consents, and waivers under
this Agreement must be delivered in writing to the other
party at the address set forth below and will be effective
upon receipt. Each party may change its address for
notice by giving the other party notice of such new
address.<br>
<br>
<b>11. General.</b> Licensee may not transfer the Source
Code or assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement to any third party without RFM’s express
prior written consent; any attempted assignment in
violation of the foregoing will be void and without
effect and will constitute grounds for termination of this
Agreement by RFM. Any waiver of a right or remedy
under this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any
other right or remedy, or of the same right or remedy
upon any other occasion. This Agreement may be
amended only by means of a written agreement signed
by both parties; any additional or inconsistent term in
any order form, acknowledgment form, brochure,
manual, sales literature, or other document shall have no
effect and is hereby rejected. If any provision of this
Agreement is unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect. This
Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of
Texas as such laws apply to contracts to be performed
entirely within Texas by Texas residents.<br>
<br>
<b>12. Entire Agreement.</b> This Agreement is the final,
complete and exclusive expression of the parties’
agreement concerning its subject matter and supersedes
any prior or contemporaneous statements,
understandings, representations, warranties, promises,
or other communication regarding the same.
